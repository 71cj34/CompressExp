# CompressExp
Electron app to compress videos quickly and easily. No dependencies, no installation.

# WARNING
Currently nonfunctional! Almost finished.

**Never mind, apparently this was moot as Electron is too fat and massive (I blame chromium (and node but mostly chromium)) to fit on github (over 100MB). I won't push anything until I finally finish this project and get some binaries.**

# Roadmap
- Finish app in current state
- Reimplement disabled features (scaling, custom output locations)
- File Explorer one-click usage (adding to context menu)
